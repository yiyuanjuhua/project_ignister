# 🏢 CursorRIPER Σ BMAD Configuration
# Version: 1.0.0
# Enable/disable BMAD-Method enterprise features

## 📋 BMAD-Method Integration for CursorRIPER Σ

This configuration file enables BMAD-Method enterprise features within
the CursorRIPER Σ framework, transforming it from memory-bank driven
to PRD-driven methodology.

### 🛠️ Available Components:

#### Β - Role System
# Professional role delineation and permissions
# Product Owner, Architect, Developer, QA, DevOps roles
# @file .cursor/rules/bmad_roles.mdc

#### Ρ - PRD System
# Product Requirements Document management
# Transforms memory banks into structured PRDs
# @file .cursor/rules/prd_system.mdc

#### Κ - Quality Gates  
# Enterprise-grade quality checkpoints
# Sequential gate progression with approvals
# @file .cursor/rules/quality_gates.mdc

#### Ε - Enterprise Features
# Documentation generation, versioning, compliance, audit
# Professional project management capabilities
# @file .cursor/rules/enterprise.mdc

### 📝 Configuration Instructions:

1. **Choose your adoption level**:
   - **Soft Migration**: Keep memory banks, add PRD system alongside
   - **Full Adoption**: Complete PRD-driven workflow with gates

2. **Enable desired components** by uncommenting @file directives above

3. **Initialize PRD structure**:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p prd/active prd/templates prd/archive
   mkdir -p quality/gates quality/checklists
   mkdir -p docs/generated docs/compliance
   ```

4. **Configure roles** for your team:
   - Assign primary roles to team members
   - Set up approval chains for gates
   - Configure permissions per role

### 🔄 Migration Path:

#### Phase 1: Preparation
- Enable role system (Β)
- Familiarize team with roles
- Keep existing memory banks

#### Phase 2: PRD Introduction
- Enable PRD system (Ρ)
- Create first PRD from memory banks
- Run both systems in parallel

#### Phase 3: Quality Implementation
- Enable quality gates (Κ)
- Start with soft enforcement
- Gradually increase strictness

#### Phase 4: Full Enterprise
- Enable enterprise features (Ε)
- Activate compliance tracking
- Complete migration

### 📊 Component Dependencies:

```
Β (Roles) → Independent
Ρ (PRD) → Requires Β
Κ (Gates) → Requires Β + Ρ  
Ε (Enterprise) → Requires all
```

### 🔗 Integration with Core Framework:

- RIPER modes (Ω) map to BMAD roles (Β)
- Memory banks (σ) migrate to PRD components (Ρ)
- Protection system (Ψ) remains unchanged
- Context system (Γ) enhanced with role context

### ⚡ Quick Commands:

```
# Role Management
!br - Switch role
!bra - Show role artifacts

# PRD Operations  
!prd - Open active PRD
!prdn - Create new PRD

# Gate Control
!kg - Check current gate
!kga - Approve gate

# Enterprise
!edg - Generate docs
!ecr - Compliance report
```

### ⚠️ Important Notes:

- BMAD integration is optional and modular
- Can be enabled/disabled without affecting core framework
- Designed for teams requiring enterprise governance
- Maintains CursorRIPER Σ's efficiency and symbolic notation
